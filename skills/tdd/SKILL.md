# Test-Driven Development

## When to use

- The user wants to build a feature or fix a bug using test-first development
- The user mentions TDD, "red-green-refactor", or asks for integration tests
- You want to ensure behavior is verified through public interfaces before implementing

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests should verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't.

**Good tests** are integration-style: they exercise real code paths through public APIs. They describe _what_ the system does, not _how_ it does it. A good test reads like a specification - "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists. These tests survive refactors because they don't care about internal structure.

**Bad tests** are coupled to implementation. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through external means (like querying a database directly instead of using the interface). The warning sign: your test breaks when you refactor, but behavior hasn't changed. If you rename an internal function and tests fail, those tests were testing implementation, not behavior.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** This is "horizontal slicing" - treating RED as "write all tests" and GREEN as "write all code."

This produces **crap tests**:

- Tests written in bulk test _imagined_ behavior, not _actual_ behavior
- You end up testing the _shape_ of things (data structures, function signatures) rather than user-facing behavior
- Tests become insensitive to real changes - they pass when behavior breaks, fail when behavior is fine
- You outrun your headlights, committing to test structure before understanding the implementation

**Correct approach**: Vertical slices via tracer bullets. One test → one implementation → repeat. Each test responds to what you learned from the previous cycle. Because you just wrote the code, you know exactly what behavior matters and how to verify it.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED→GREEN: test1→impl1
  RED→GREEN: test2→impl2
  RED→GREEN: test3→impl3
  ...
```

## Workflow

### 1. Planning

When exploring the codebase, use `read`, `grep`, `find`, or read-only `bash` commands — or dispatch a `scout` subagent for broader exploration. Read the project's domain glossary (look for `CONTEXT.md` or `context.md` — case-insensitive) so that test names and interface vocabulary match the project's language, and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

Before writing any code:

- [ ] Confirm with user what interface changes are needed
- [ ] Confirm with user which behaviors to test (prioritize)
- [ ] Identify opportunities for [deep modules](deep-modules.md) (small interface, deep implementation)
- [ ] Design interfaces for [testability](interface-design.md)
- [ ] List the behaviors to test (not implementation steps)
- [ ] Get user approval on the plan

**You can't test everything.** Confirm with the user exactly which behaviors matter most. Focus testing effort on critical paths and complex logic, not every possible edge case.

### 1.5 Criteria Audit (after plan approval)

**After the plan is approved by the user**, dispatch a `criteria-auditor` subagent to cross-reference the plan's intended behaviors against the issue's acceptance criteria.

```
dispatch subagent: criteria-auditor
task: |
  Audit the acceptance criteria in {issue_path} against the planned test coverage.
  The plan intends to cover these behaviors: {list from step 1}.
  Test directory: {test_dir}
  Source directory: {src_dir}
  Report any criteria that lack planned test coverage.
```

This catches gaps **before any code is written** — if a criterion has no corresponding test in the plan, surface it now.

### 2. Tracer Bullet

Write ONE test that confirms ONE thing about the system:

```
RED:   Write test for first behavior → test fails
GREEN: Write minimal code to pass → test passes
```

This is your tracer bullet - proves the path works end-to-end.

### 2.5 Checkpoint Review (after tracer bullet)

**After the tracer bullet passes (GREEN)**, dispatch a `checkpoint-reviewer` subagent to verify the first slice before continuing.

```
dispatch subagent: checkpoint-reviewer
task: |
  Review the first TDD slice (tracer bullet).
  Issue: {issue_path}
  Slice description: {tracer bullet behavior}
  Changed files: {list of files modified}
  Test files: {list of test files modified/added}
```

This catches foundational problems early — wrong abstractions, missing gates, boundary violations — before they compound across subsequent slices.

### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior:

```
RED:   Write next test → fails
GREEN: Minimal code to pass → passes
```

Rules:

- One test at a time
- Only enough code to pass current test
- Don't anticipate future tests
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior

### 3.5 Periodic Checkpoint Reviews

Dispatch `checkpoint-reviewer` **after every integration-boundary slice** — a slice that:

- Touches a public API or changes a function signature
- Adds a new module boundary or cross-module call
- Introduces a new gate/conditional that other slices depend on
- Wires a new integration (e.g., connects module A to module B)

For simple slices (adding another test for the same behavior, refactoring), a checkpoint review is not necessary.

```
dispatch subagent: checkpoint-reviewer
task: |
  Review TDD slice: {slice_description}
  Issue: {issue_path}
  Changed files: {list}
  Test files: {list}
  Previous slices: {brief summary of what earlier slices implemented}
```

### 4. Refactor

After all tests pass, look for [refactor candidates](refactoring.md):

- [ ] Extract duplication
- [ ] Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles where natural
- [ ] Consider what new code reveals about existing code
- [ ] Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first.

### 4.5 Final Quality Gate

**After all slices are complete and refactored**, dispatch both subagents for a final quality gate:

```
dispatch subagent: criteria-auditor
task: |
  Full audit of acceptance criteria coverage.
  Issue: {issue_path}
  Test directory: {test_dir}
  Source directory: {src_dir}
  Verify every checkbox in the issue has a dedicated test AND implementation.
```

```
dispatch subagent: checkpoint-reviewer
task: |
  Final review of all slices.
  Issue: {issue_path}
  Changed files: {all files changed across all slices}
  Test files: {all test files added/modified}
  Previous slices: {summary of all slices}
```

Only proceed to mark the issue complete once both reports show no BLOCKERs.

## Rules

- Write one test at a time. Write minimal code to pass. Then move to the next test.
- Tests must verify behavior through public interfaces only — never test implementation details.
- Never write all tests first (horizontal slicing). Use vertical tracer bullets instead.
- Never refactor while RED. Get to GREEN first.
- When exploring the codebase, use `read`, `grep`, `find`, or read-only `bash` — or dispatch a `scout` subagent for broader exploration.
- Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary from `CONTEXT.md` throughout. Look for both `CONTEXT.md` and `context.md` (case-insensitive) when searching.
- Respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.
- Mock only at system boundaries (external APIs, databases, time, file system). Do not mock your own classes or internal collaborators.
- Use `read` over shelling out to `cat` for file contents.
- Dispatch `criteria-auditor` after plan approval (step 1.5) and after all slices (step 4.5).
- Dispatch `checkpoint-reviewer` after the tracer bullet (step 2.5), after integration-boundary slices (step 3.5), and after all slices (step 4.5).
- Fix all BLOCKERs from checkpoint reviews before proceeding to the next slice. CONCERNs and NOTEs can be deferred but must be tracked.
